# ROS2-Based Screw Propelled Autonomous Amphibious Robot


## Project Overview

This project introduces a **ROS2-based Screw Propelled Amphibious Robot** capable of navigating both terrestrial and aquatic environments autonomously. The robot uses a unique helical screw-wheel mechanism that allows seamless transition between land, water, mud, and sand — without any mechanical reconfiguration.

### Key Features
- Dual-terrain locomotion (land + water) using screw-propelled wheels
- Autonomous navigation via **ROS2 + SLAM**
- Real-time sensing with **LiDAR** and **ZED 2i Stereo Camera**
- Bluetooth-based manual override via smartphone
- Gazebo simulation support
- Powered by **Raspberry Pi 4B** + **Arduino Uno**

## Locomotion Modes

### 1. Screw Propulsion Mode
Used for deformable terrains — water, mud, clay, sand.
- Wheels rotate in **opposite directions**
- Helical threads displace fluid/granular media backward to generate thrust
- PID controller manages speed and torque for stability

### 2. Crab Crawl Mode
Used for rigid/uneven surfaces — rocky terrain.
- Wheels rotate in the **same direction** for lateral movement
- Screws enhance sideways grip and traction

## Mathematical Model (Kinematics)

With the chassis frame `xc Oc yc` and helix angle = 45°:

**Forward kinematics (velocity):**
```
[Vx]       [  1      1   ] [W1]
[Vy] = R/2 [  1      1   ] [W2]
[Wz]       [-1/(l1+l2)  1/(l1+l2)]
```

**Inverse kinematics (wheel speeds):**
```
[W1]   1  [  1   1  -(l1+l2) ] [Vx]
[W2] = - [ -1   1   (l1+l2)  ] [Vy]
       R                        [Wz]
```

Where:
- `R` = screw radius
- `W1, W2` = angular velocity of screws 1 and 2
- `l1, l2` = distances between screw axis and body center

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- ROS2 (Humble or later)
- Gazebo
- `robot_state_publisher`, `joint_state_publisher`, `gazebo_ros` packages
- Arduino IDE (for hardware upload)

### ROS2 Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/amphibious_bot.git
cd amphibious_bot

# Copy the ROS2 package to your workspace
cp -r ros2/amphibot_description ~/ros2_ws/src/

# Build
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```

### Launch Gazebo Simulation

```bash
# Full simulation with custom world
ros2 launch amphibot_description launch_sim.launch.py

# Visualize in RViz only
ros2 launch amphibot_description display.launch.py

# Gazebo only
ros2 launch amphibot_description gazebo.launch.py
```

### Arduino Upload

1. Open `arduino/motor_control/motor_control.ino` in Arduino IDE
2. Connect Arduino Uno via USB
3. Select **Board: Arduino Uno** and correct COM port
4. Upload the sketch
5. Pair HC-05 with your smartphone (default PIN: `1234`)
6. Use any **Bluetooth RC Controller** app and send commands: `F` / `B` / `L` / `R` / `S`

## Bluetooth Control Commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `F` | Move Forward |
| `B` | Move Backward |
| `L` | Turn Left |
